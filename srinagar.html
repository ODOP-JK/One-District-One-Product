        Pashmina Shawls are a fine variant of shawls spun from cashmere wools.
        A cashmere wool itself is obtained from the Changthangi goat (Capra
        aegagrus hircus) native to the high plateau of Ladakh.

          <p>Pashmina shawls are an exclusiveart of Kashmir. Other countries
            have unsuccessfully tried to duplicate the art. These shawls are
            woven by weavers who have been into this craftsmanship
            forgenerations and have inherited this art from their ancestors.

          <p>Pashmina wool is incredibly soft, making it feel luxurious and
            silky against the skin. The fine diameter of the wool fibers is
            responsible for its softness, which can be as small as microns.
            Warmth: Pashmina wool is incredibly warm, making it ideal for
            colder temperatures.

          <p>The word, Pashmina is derived from the Persian word, pashm, the
            soft gold or the king of fibres. As the word suggests, it attains
            royalty in its being. The journey of the Pashmina dates back to
            the 15th century in the Kashmir Valley of India.
